# UCDPythonProject
UCD Python Project
For this project, I chose to do Python analysis on Premier League statistics spanning the last 22 years.
 The purpose of the application was to develop a Python project to analyse a real-world scenario and generate valuable insights by visualizing information. The project aims to analyse data from different data sources, manipulate information and visualise to generate insights.
Using Jupyter notebook as my platform and a host of useful resources such as packages NumPy and Pandas, an API from AlphaVantage and Visualization tools from Plotly, I was able to develop and implement the functionality required for the project.
